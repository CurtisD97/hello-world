# hello-world
first repository 

Hi everyone, this is the first time i have used this type of software so i am hoping to learn alot 
of it and gather everyones opinions on my code and hopefully i can give my knowledge to those who 
need it. I study computing at st helens college with things such as web and programming involved 
on the course.
